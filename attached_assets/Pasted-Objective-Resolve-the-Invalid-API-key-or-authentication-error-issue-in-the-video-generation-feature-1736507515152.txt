Objective: Resolve the Invalid API key or authentication error issue in the video generation feature. Ensure the API key is correctly set up and authenticated. Follow these steps:

1. Verify the API Key
Check that the API key is valid:
Confirm the API key in use matches the one provided by the video generation API service (e.g., RunwayML).
If necessary, regenerate a new API key from the providerâ€™s dashboard and replace the existing one.
2. Confirm API Key Usage
Ensure the API key is included correctly in the request headers:
python
Copy code
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
Log the headers to verify the API key is being passed:
python
Copy code
print("Authorization Header:", headers["Authorization"])
3. Check Environment Variables
Ensure the API key is securely stored and loaded via environment variables.
Verify in Replit that the API key is correctly set in the .env file:
plaintext
Copy code
API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
Access the environment variable in the code:
python
Copy code
import os
api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")
print("Loaded API Key:", api_key)
If the API key is not loading, ensure Replit's environment variable feature is properly configured.
4. Validate Backend API Request
Ensure the backend properly forwards the API key to the external service:
python
Copy code
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.runwayml.com/v1/videos/generate",
    headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "title": "Test Video",
        "description": "Sample description",
        "duration": 10
    }
)
print("Response Status Code:", response.status_code)
print("Response Content:", response.text)
5. Debug Possible API Restrictions
Verify the API key has the necessary permissions:
Check if the key is restricted to certain IPs or domains.
Ensure the key has access to the /v1/videos/generate endpoint.
If using a trial account or quota-limited plan, ensure the key has sufficient credits or access.
6. Test Authentication Independently
Use a tool like Postman or curl to test the API key:
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST https://api.runwayml.com/v1/videos/generate \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"title": "Test Video", "description": "Sample description", "duration": 10}'
If the test succeeds, the issue lies in the app's request logic.
If the test fails, consult the API documentation or provider support.
7. Implement Clear Error Handling
Add error handling to inform users of invalid credentials:
python
Copy code
if response.status_code == 401:
    return {"error": "Invalid API key. Please check your credentials."}
Log the full response for debugging:
python
Copy code
print("Error Response:", response.json())
Deliverables
API key verified and properly configured.
Backend successfully authenticates with the video generation API.
Clear error handling for invalid or missing API keys.
Logs to monitor and troubleshoot future authentication issues.
