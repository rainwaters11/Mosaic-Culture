Prompt for Replit Whisperer: Finalize App for Deployment and GitHub Transfer
Objective: Finalize the Mosaic Culture app for deployment and prepare it for transfer to GitHub. Ensure the app is functional, optimized, and structured for collaboration. Follow these steps:

1. Organize Project Files
Ensure the project directory is well-structured:
/app.py: Main application file.
/templates/: HTML files (e.g., index.html, gallery.html, submit.html).
/static/: CSS, JavaScript, images, and other static assets.
/requirements.txt: All Python dependencies.
.env: Environment variables (exclude from GitHub).
Add a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
plaintext
Copy code
__pycache__/
.env
*.log
.DS_Store
node_modules/
2. Clean and Optimize Code
Remove unused imports, variables, and debug logs.
Add comments and docstrings to key functions for clarity.
Example:
python
Copy code
@app.route("/generate_audio", methods=["POST"])
def generate_audio():
    """
    Generates audio from the submitted text using ElevenLabs API.
    """
    # Implementation
3. Ensure Full Functionality
Test all features:

Submit Story: Verify stories are saved and displayed correctly.
Gallery: Ensure stories load without issues.
Social Sharing: Confirm social media share buttons work as intended.
Audio Generation: Ensure ElevenLabs integration is functional.
Add error handling:

Ensure missing or invalid inputs are handled gracefully.
Example:
python
Copy code
@app.route("/submit", methods=["POST"])
def submit_story():
    if not request.json.get("title"):
        return {"error": "Title is required"}, 400
4. Prepare for Deployment
Environment Variables:
Use os.getenv() for sensitive configurations like API keys.
Confirm the .env file is excluded from GitHub.
Static Files:
Ensure CSS, JavaScript, and images are properly linked and load correctly.
Database Configuration:
Ensure database URIs (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) are loaded from environment variables.
5. Generate requirements.txt
Create or update requirements.txt to include all dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Ensure essential packages are listed (e.g., Flask, SQLAlchemy, google-cloud-texttospeech).
6. Write a Comprehensive README.md
Add the following sections:
Project Name: Mosaic Culture
