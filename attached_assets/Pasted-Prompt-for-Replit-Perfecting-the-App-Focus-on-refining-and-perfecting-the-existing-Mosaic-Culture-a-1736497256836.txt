Prompt for Replit: Perfecting the App
Focus on refining and perfecting the existing Mosaic Culture app without adding new features. The goal is to ensure seamless functionality, user experience, and performance. Address the following areas:

1. Debugging and Fixing Existing Features
Generate AI Illustration:
Ensure that the image generation feature works flawlessly with the selected API.
Debug any issues in the flow from input to output (e.g., API calls, response handling, and rendering images).
Generate Audio Narration:
Confirm the audio generation feature works smoothly, from capturing user input to generating audio and playing it on the frontend.
2. Improving Performance
Optimize API calls to reduce latency.
Cache generated content (images/audio) to avoid redundant API calls.
Ensure efficient resource usage to handle multiple users simultaneously.
3. Enhancing User Experience
Refine the UI design for consistency and ease of use.
Ensure navigation between pages (e.g., story submission, gallery) is intuitive.
Add clear feedback for users (e.g., “Generating your image...”).
4. Testing and Validation
Write comprehensive tests for all features to identify and fix edge cases.
Test user input validation (e.g., handle empty or invalid inputs gracefully).
Simulate real-world scenarios to ensure the app functions smoothly under various conditions.
5. Error Handling
Add robust error handling for:
API failures (e.g., show an appropriate error message if the image/audio generation fails).
Network issues (e.g., retry API requests if a connection fails).
Ensure all errors are logged for troubleshooting.
6. Polishing the App
Apply consistent branding (e.g., Mosaic Culture color scheme, fonts, and icons).
Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop users.
Improve animations or transitions for a polished look and feel.
Key Goals:
Eliminate bugs and ensure the app is stable and reliable.
Optimize for performance and usability.
Provide a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
Do not add any new features at this time. Focus solely on refining and perfecting the existing app.
