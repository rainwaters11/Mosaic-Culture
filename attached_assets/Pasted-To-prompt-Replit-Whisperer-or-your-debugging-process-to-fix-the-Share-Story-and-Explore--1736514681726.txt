To prompt **Replit Whisperer** (or your debugging process) to fix the **Share Story** and **Explore** buttons that donâ€™t work, you can craft a clear and detailed prompt as follows:

---

### **Prompt for Replit Whisperer: Fix Broken Buttons**
> **Objective**: The `Share Story` and `Explore` buttons on the Mosaic Culture app are not functioning. Identify the root cause and ensure both buttons work as intended. Follow these steps:
>
> ### **1. Debug the Button Functionality**
> - Verify the buttons are properly linked to their respective actions:
>   - **Share Story**: Should navigate to the story submission page or trigger a sharing modal.
>   - **Explore**: Should navigate to the story gallery or trigger a filtered view of stories.
>
> Example HTML:
> ```html
> <button id="share-story-btn">Share Story</button>
> <button id="explore-btn">Explore</button>
> ```
>
> ### **2. Check Event Listeners**
> - Confirm that the buttons have event listeners attached in the JavaScript:
>   ```javascript
>   document.getElementById("share-story-btn").addEventListener("click", function () {
>       window.location.href = "/submit";
>   });

>   document.getElementById("explore-btn").addEventListener("click", function () {
>       window.location.href = "/gallery";
>   });
>   ```
> - Add debugging logs to ensure the click events are firing:
>   ```javascript
>   console.log("Share Story button clicked");
>   console.log("Explore button clicked");
>   ```

---

> ### **3. Verify Routes and Navigation**
> - Check that the routes `/submit` and `/gallery` (or their respective routes) exist in your backend framework (e.g., Flask, Django, Express).
> - Example Flask routes:
>   ```python
>   @app.route("/submit")
>   def submit_story():
>       return render_template("submit.html")

>   @app.route("/gallery")
>   def story_gallery():
>       return render_template("gallery.html")
>   ```

---

> ### **4. Test Backend Responses**
> - Verify the backend returns the correct content for the `/submit` and `/gallery` routes:
>   - Use a tool like **Postman** or a browser to visit these URLs directly.
>   - Ensure they load the expected pages without errors.
>
> Example Response Test:
> ```bash
> curl http://localhost:5000/submit
> curl http://localhost:5000/gallery
> ```

---

> ### **5. Check Button Styling and Visibility**
> - Ensure the buttons are styled properly and not hidden or disabled:
>   ```css
>   #share-story-btn, #explore-btn {
>       display: block;
>       pointer-events: auto;
>   }
>   ```
> - Add hover effects and feedback to indicate they are clickable:
>   ```css
>   button:hover {
>       background-color: #4caf50;
>   }
>   ```

---

> ### **6. Test Edge Cases**
> - Test the buttons in different scenarios:
>   - What happens if the user clicks them without being logged in?
>   - Do they work on mobile devices?
>   - Does a network error prevent navigation?

---

### **Deliverables**
1. The `Share Story` button navigates to the story submission page or triggers the appropriate action (e.g., opening a modal or a new page).
2. The `Explore` button navigates to the story gallery or displays the appropriate content.
3. Debugging logs confirm that event listeners are attached and firing correctly.
4. Routes and backend responses are verified to ensure proper functionality.

This prompt provides clear steps for debugging and ensures that both buttons work seamlessly. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸš€
