To troubleshoot the feature in Replit, you need to guide it step-by-step to identify where the issue might lie. A structured troubleshooting prompt can help you debug the issue effectively.

### **Troubleshooting Prompt for Replit**

> **Help troubleshoot the `Generate AI Illustration` and `Generate Audio Narration` features in the Mosaic Culture app. Follow these steps to identify and fix the issue:**
>
> ### **1. Review API Integration**
> - Check if the API keys and endpoints for the image generation and audio narration features are configured correctly.
> - Ensure the API requests include all required parameters.
> - Provide a step-by-step review of the API call functions and suggest improvements if they are incorrectly implemented.
>
> Example Debugging Code:
> ```python
> import requests
>
> # Example test function to debug API request
> def test_api_call():
>     api_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations"
>     headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
>     data = {"prompt": "Test prompt", "n": 1, "size": "512x512"}
>
>     response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json=data)
>     print("Response Status Code:", response.status_code)
>     print("Response Content:", response.text)
> ```
> - **Run the test function and log the output.** Verify if the response contains the expected data or an error message.

---

> ### **2. Test User Input Handling**
> - Ensure the user input is being properly captured and passed to the backend functions.
> - Add debugging logs to confirm the data flow:
> ```python
> def capture_user_input(input_text):
>     print("User Input Captured:", input_text)  # Debugging log
>     return input_text
> ```
> - Suggest fixes if the input is not reaching the API function.

---

> ### **3. Debug API Response Handling**
> - Verify that the API responses are being parsed and handled correctly in the application.
> - Add logs to capture the API response:
> ```python
> def handle_api_response(response):
>     print("API Response:", response.json())  # Debugging log
> ```
> - If there are errors, suggest modifications to handle different response statuses (e.g., 400, 401, 500).

---

> ### **4. Frontend and Backend Communication**
> - Ensure the frontend is correctly sending requests to the backend and displaying the results.
> - Check:
>   - Is the frontend passing the input correctly to the backend API route?
>   - Is the backend returning the generated image/audio URL to the frontend?
> - Add logs to confirm communication:
> ```python
> @app.route('/generate_image', methods=['POST'])
> def generate_image_endpoint():
>     data = request.json
>     print("Received Data in Backend:", data)  # Debugging log
> ```

---

> ### **5. Validate API Keys and Environment**
> - Verify that the API keys are valid and have the necessary permissions.
> - Ensure environment variables are correctly loaded in Replit:
> ```python
> import os
> print("API Key Loaded:", os.getenv("API_KEY"))
> ```

---

> ### **6. Testing Edge Cases**
> - Test the features with:
>   - Empty inputs.
>   - Invalid prompts (e.g., overly long or nonsensical text).
>   - Unavailable APIs (simulate downtime or bad responses).
> - Ensure error handling is robust and user-friendly.

---

> ### **7. General Debugging Best Practices**
> - Add debug logs throughout the code:
> ```python
> print("Function X executed")
> print("Variable Y value:", y)
> ```
> - Use try-except blocks to catch errors:
> ```python
> try:
>     response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json=data)
>     response.raise_for_status()
> except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
>     print("Error during API call:", e)
> ```

---

> **Deliverable**:
> - Identify and fix the issues preventing the features from working.
> - Ensure both `Generate AI Illustration` and `Generate Audio Narration` are functional.
> - Provide a summary of changes made to resolve the issues.
