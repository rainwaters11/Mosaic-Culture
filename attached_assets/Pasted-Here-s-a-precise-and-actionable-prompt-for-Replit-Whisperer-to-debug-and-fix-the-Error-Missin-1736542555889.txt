Hereâ€™s a precise and actionable **prompt for Replit Whisperer** to debug and fix the **Error: Missing story_id** issue:

### **Prompt for Replit Whisperer: Fix Missing `story_id` Error**
> **Objective**: Fix the `Error: Missing story_id` issue in the Mosaic Culture app. Ensure that `story_id` is correctly passed, handled, and used in the application. Follow these steps:
>
> ### **1. Identify Where `story_id` is Missing**
> - **Trace the Source**:
>   - Check if `story_id` is passed from the frontend to the backend.
>   - Verify if the `story_id` parameter is included in:
>     - **URL** (e.g., `/stories/<story_id>`)
>     - **Request Payload** (e.g., JSON in a POST or PUT request).
> - Add debugging logs in the backend to check if `story_id` is received:
>   ```python
>   @app.route("/story/<story_id>", methods=["GET"])
>   def get_story(story_id):
>       if not story_id:
>           return {"error": "Missing story_id"}, 400
>       print(f"Received story_id: {story_id}")
>       # Fetch the story from the database
>   ```

---

> ### **2. Debug the Frontend**
> - Ensure the frontend correctly sends the `story_id`:
>   - **URL**:
>     - If the route expects `story_id` in the URL (e.g., `/story/<story_id>`), confirm it is correctly appended:
>       ```javascript
>       const storyId = 123;
>       fetch(`/story/${storyId}`, { method: "GET" });
>       ```
>   - **Request Body**:
>     - If `story_id` is sent in the request body (e.g., POST request), ensure it is included:
>       ```javascript
>       fetch("/story", {
>           method: "POST",
>           headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
>           body: JSON.stringify({ story_id: 123 }),
>       });
>       ```
> - Add debugging logs in the frontend:
>   ```javascript
>   console.log("Sending story_id:", storyId);
>   ```

---

> ### **3. Validate Backend Logic**
> - Check how `story_id` is retrieved in the backend:
>   - **From URL Parameters**:
>     ```python
>     story_id = request.view_args.get("story_id")
>     if not story_id:
>         return {"error": "Missing story_id"}, 400
>     ```
>   - **From Request JSON**:
>     ```python
>     story_id = request.json.get("story_id")
>     if not story_id:
>         return {"error": "Missing story_id in request body"}, 400
>     ```
> - Ensure consistent handling of `story_id` between the frontend and backend.

---

> ### **4. Test the Data Flow**
> - Verify the complete flow of `story_id`:
>   - Frontend â†’ Backend â†’ Database â†’ Response
> - Add debugging logs at each step to confirm `story_id` is passed correctly:
>   ```python
>   print(f"Received story_id: {story_id}")
>   print(f"Fetching story with ID: {story_id}")
>   ```

---

> ### **5. Handle Edge Cases**
> - Ensure the app handles scenarios where `story_id` is missing or invalid:
>   - Return a meaningful error message:
>     ```python
>     if not story_id:
>         return {"error": "Story ID is required to perform this action"}, 400
>     ```
>   - Validate `story_id` (e.g., it should be a valid number or UUID).

---

> ### **6. Test and Validate**
> - Test the app with:
>   - A valid `story_id`.
>   - A missing or invalid `story_id`.
> - Confirm the error is resolved and the app behaves as expected.

---

### **Deliverables**
1. A fully functional app where `story_id` is passed and handled correctly.
2. Debugging logs added to trace the flow of `story_id` from the frontend to the backend.
3. Clear error handling for missing or invalid `story_id`.
